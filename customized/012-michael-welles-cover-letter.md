I'm reaching out about the Staff Backend Engineer role on Patreon's Creation team. I've spent my career building backend systems that handle real-world scale and complexity, and I'm drawn to Patreon's mission of funding the creative class.

At Istari Digital, I led a small team building the core platform and SDKs for use in digital engineering worfkflows to automate the validation and testing of engine, aircraft and rocket designs used by clients such complex data relationships with careful schema design and query optimization. Before that at Raytheon, I built streaming pipelines processing the telemetry from thousands of sensors in new real time using Python and Spark to detect faults, anomolies and predict parts failures in aircraft engines.  The work required solid technical design, good collaboration with subject matter experts and product teams, and a focus on reliability, auditability, and most of all correctness.

I care about creators. I've built products for highly regulated industries where getting it wrong has real consequences. At Patreon, getting it right means creators can focus on their work instead of fighting their tools. That's work worth doing.

I'm based in Brooklyn and happy to be in your New York office twice a week.
