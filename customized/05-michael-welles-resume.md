Istari Digital enables zero‑trust digital collaboration for cyber‑physical systems, connecting engineering tools through programmatic and AI-assisted automation.

- Led team building secure backend registry service (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL) serving internal engineering teams and external API consumers. Designed database schema for asset relationships and metadata, tuned queries for complex graph traversal, and managed zero-downtime migrations.
- Worked directly with internal users to rapidly prototype features for asset lineage tracking and metadata management. Built APIs that abstracted storage complexity while enabling teams to access their data efficiently.
- Cryptographic core written in Rust with bindings for Python and WebAssembly, wrapped by Python and TypeScript SDKs. Designed API interfaces balancing ease-of-use with performance requirements.
- Built CI/CD pipeline that validated compliance requirements on each release, enabling fast iteration without compromising reliability.

### Director of Software Development, Raytheon Technologies
*Sep 2021 - Nov 2023 · New York, NY*

Led development of next‑generation data platform for aerospace applications at Enterprise Data Services (formerly UTC Digital Accelerator).

- Technical lead for real-time flight telemetry pipelines processing thousands of engine sensors through fault detection and anomaly detection models. Built streaming data platform (Databricks, Spark, Python) handling high-throughput sensor data with millisecond performance requirements, triggering automated alerts based on severity.
- Designed ML model training and orchestration pipeline with comprehensive audit trails. Implemented parallel evaluation of multiple models without adding latency using asynchronous patterns and concurrent processing.
- Led platform team serving 40+ internal engineering teams adopting Databricks. Built SDKs for parsing proprietary data formats, quickstart kits, and synthetic data generators to accelerate internal users. Routed around blockers and worked with ambiguity to ship features quickly.
- Led team of 14 developers across three agile projects while managing platform migration for diverse internal customers.

### Head of Technology, Dayforward
*Jan 2020 - Sep 2021 · New York, NY*

Head of technology for life‑insurance startup. Led team that designed and built algorithmic underwriting and policy‑management platform.

- Built platform with Go microservices on Kubernetes, federated GraphQL API, and Vue.js frontend. Designed API contracts and data models for policy management, underwriting workflows, and integration with external systems.
- Completed initial development in under ten months, launching the same day the company received regulatory approval. Made pragmatic tradeoffs to deliver quickly without compromising reliability.
- Architected distributed system with async message processing, idempotency, and retry logic for critical financial transactions.

### Director of Software Engineering, UTC Aerospace Systems
*Feb 2019 - Jan 2020 · Brooklyn, NY*

Managed team of 17 engineers at UTC Digital Accelerator. Oversaw multiple platform teams—from IoT sensors and mobile apps to developer tools and design systems. Led efforts to standardize engineering processes and best practices across teams.

### Lead Engineer / Chief Technologist, Riverdrop
