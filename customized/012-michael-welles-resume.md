## Overview

Product-minded backend engineer with 8+ years building scalable Python services for high-growth platforms. Proven track record delivering well-scoped features on time while championing best practices in system design, observability, and testing. Experienced collaborating with cross-functional teams (product, design, data) to ship high-quality features that drive creator engagement. I mentor engineers to build strong product engineering culture, compress the build-ship-iterate loop, and balance velocity with maintainability through pragmatic CI/CD and disciplined SDLC practices.
