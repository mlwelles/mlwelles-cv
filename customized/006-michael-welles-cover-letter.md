I'm reaching out about the Distinguished Engineer position because the challenge you're describing—leading an enterprise cloud migration over multiple years while keeping a complex payments system running—is exactly the kind of problem I've spent my career solving.

At Raytheon, I led the technical effort to build a new cloud-native data platform on Databricks while simultaneously supporting 40+ teams migrating from legacy systems. The tricky part wasn't the technology—it was figuring out how to move teams incrementally without a "big bang" cutover. We built the streaming telemetry pipeline for Pratt & Whitney jet engines in chunks: first the ingestion layer, then fault detection, then the alerting system. Each piece shipped value to production before the next one started. When you're dealing with systems that can't afford downtime (like grounding a commercial aircraft fleet), you learn to design for incremental delivery.

That experience taught me something important about large-scale migrations: the technical architecture matters less than the relationships you build with the teams doing the work. I spent as much time collaborating with operations, data scientists, and engineering leaders as I did writing code. We created "inner-source" SDKs and quickstart kits so teams could self-serve instead of waiting on us. We established CI/CD patterns that became the standard across the organization. The goal was always to make the new platform so much easier that teams wanted to move, not because they had to.

I've also done this migration journey from the startup side. At Dayforward, we built a life insurance platform on Kubernetes and AWS from scratch—Go microservices, federated GraphQL, the whole stack. We launched in ten months, and it had to pass state insurance regulators on day one. No room for "we'll fix it later." That taught me how to balance velocity with compliance, which seems directly relevant to a payments company that needs to maintain SLAs and audit requirements while modernizing infrastructure.

What excites me about Early Warning is the scope of the problem. You're not just moving applications to the cloud—you're doing it for a payments platform that thousands of institutions depend on. That requires someone who can work at multiple altitudes: designing the overall migration strategy with executives, debugging Kubernetes networking issues with the team, and convincing a skeptical architect that the new approach will actually work. I've done all of those, often in the same week.

I also appreciate that you're looking for someone who can coach up the team. At MediData, I took over a mobile engineering organization that was struggling with velocity. We instituted better CI/CD practices, moved to Swift and Kotlin, and improved their sprint throughput by 2.5×—not by working harder, but by removing friction and establishing clearer engineering standards. At Huge, I built an engineering guild system that turned individual contributors into leaders who drove their own R&D initiatives. One of those initiatives turned into a $5M contract.

I know this is a multi-year effort, and that's what makes it interesting. You need someone who can own it end-to-end—roadmaps, estimates, architecture decisions, team development, stakeholder management. I've led those kinds of long-term initiatives before, and I know how to keep momentum when the work stretches across quarters and the organization inevitably shifts priorities.

I'd welcome the chance to talk more about what you're building and how I can help. The problems you're solving—migrating enterprise systems to the cloud while maintaining reliability and compliance—are exactly the kind of technical and organizational challenges I'm best at.

Thanks for considering my application.
