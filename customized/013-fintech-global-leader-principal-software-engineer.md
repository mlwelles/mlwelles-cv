Principal Software Engineer – Global Fintech Innovation

Why This Role?

If you’re looking for a chance to work on systems that matter — systems that move money across the globe, protect billions in assets, and enable the future of finance — this is that opportunity.

We’re building the next generation of fintech infrastructure, and we need a Principal Software Engineer who thrives on complexity, scale, and impact.

What You’ll Actually Do

    Lead design sessions for high-scale payment and trading systems.
    Roll up your sleeves and code — yes, even at this level, we expect hands-on contribution.
    Mentor engineers and help them level up their design and coding skills.
    Keep a sharp eye on security, compliance, and regulatory requirements in every decision.
    Work with product leaders to define what “next-generation fintech” looks like.

What We’re Looking For

    10+ years of experience building distributed systems in production.
    Expertise in Java, C++, or Python — and the ability to evaluate new technologies critically.
    Deep understanding of cloud-native architecture and data-intensive applications.
    Experience working in fintech, banking, or another domain where security and uptime are non-negotiable.
    Strong leadership skills, but a builder’s mindset — you still love to code.

Why You’ll Love It

You’ll be part of a global fintech leader that is defining how financial systems evolve. You’ll work on high-stakes engineering problems with an elite team, and your work will have a visible impact on the way people and businesses move money worldwide.
