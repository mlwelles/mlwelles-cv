I'm writing to apply for the Principal Engineer/Software Architect position at PHIL. Your mission to streamline prescription management resonates with me—I've spent much of my career taking complex, rule-heavy systems in regulated industries and making them work better.

At Dayforward, I led the team that built an entire life insurance underwriting platform from scratch. We had to navigate regulatory approval while building the product, and we launched the day we got approval—about ten months from start to finish. It taught me how to balance moving fast with getting compliance right, which seems directly relevant to what you're doing in the pharmacy space.

More recently at Raytheon, I worked on systems that processed real-time telemetry from jet engines to detect faults and trigger alerts. The interesting challenge there was handling thousands of sensors and complex decision logic at scale while maintaining reliability—if you get it wrong, planes don't fly. I think prescription management has similar characteristics: lots of data, complicated workflows, and stakes that matter.

What caught my attention in your job description is the focus on preparing for AI/LLM integration. I've been doing some of that work recently, particularly around structuring data and APIs so that models can actually use them effectively. It's an area where I think there's a lot of potential, especially for simplifying complex workflows.

I'd welcome the chance to talk about how I might help PHIL scale its platform and evolve its architecture. The combination of mission-driven work and hard technical problems is exactly what I'm looking for.
