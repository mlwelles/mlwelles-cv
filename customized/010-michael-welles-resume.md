Istari Digital enables zero-trust digital collaboration for cyber-physical systems, connecting engineering tools to enable programmatic and AI-assisted automation of digital engineering workflows.

- Architected cryptographically verified asset lineage system and DoD-compliant control tagging to preserve dependencies, provenance, and tooling metadata without exposing sensitive payloads—enabling zero-knowledge collaboration, data sovereignty, and frictionless sharing. Embedded regulatory and audit readiness into technical patterns from inception.
- Led cross-functional team building secure backend registry service (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Zanzibar, Authzed) and SDK. Designed database schema for asset relationships and metadata, tuned queries for complex lineage traversal, and managed zero-downtime migrations. Cryptographic core written in Rust with bindings for Python and WebAssembly.
- Partnered with InfoSec and compliance teams to ensure CI/CD validated all compliance requirements on each release, publishing results for ATO (Authority to Operate) submission to minimize approval effort for deployment on secure and classified networks. Designed systems that comply with regulatory frameworks from day one.

### Director of Software Development, Raytheon Technologies
*Sep 2021 - Nov 2023 · New York, NY*

Led development of next-generation data platform for aerospace applications at Enterprise Data Services (formerly UTC Digital Accelerator). Served as force multiplier across multiple engineering organizations, driving reuse and reducing duplication.

- Technical lead for pathfinder initiatives building real-time flight telemetry pipelines for Pratt & Whitney commercial jet engines. Built streaming data platform (Databricks, Spark, Python) processing thousands of engine sensors through fault detection and anomaly detection models, triggering severity-based automated alerts from emergency grounding to routine inspection scheduling.
- Designed ML model training and orchestration pipeline with comprehensive audit trails tracing every output field back to specific code revisions or model versions—ensuring auditability and regulatory compliance for safety-critical systems. Implemented threat modeling and architectural risk analysis to identify and remediate risk vectors before production deployment.
- Evangelized technical excellence through "inner-source" code addressing common problems: SDKs for parsing proprietary engine data formats, quickstart kits for Databricks projects, and synthetic data generators. Drove measurable uplift in developer productivity and time-to-market.
- Led team of 14 developers across three agile projects while supervising onboarding resources and migration support for 40+ teams adopting the new Databricks platform. Influenced governance policy and engineering standards across the enterprise.

### Head of Technology, Dayforward
