I'm reaching out about the Senior/Principal Engineer role at Orum. The combination of architectural leadership and hands-on GenAI work caught my attention because it maps directly to what I've been building.

Right now I'm advising CubeNexus on their geospatial intelligence platform with LLM-based querying. I rebuilt their multi-terabyte ingestion pipeline and added real-time telemetry streaming. Before that at Istari Digital, I led the team building cryptographically verified asset lineage systems for zero-trust collaboration in digital engineering. I designed the backend registry service and the SDK -- the cryptographic core in Rust with Python and WebAssembly bindings. We shipped on time for both commercial and government clients.

I've spent my career designing distributed systems that scale while mentoring teams and writing production code. At Raytheon I built real-time flight telemetry pipelines processing thousands of engine sensors through ML anomaly and failure prediction models and dozens of categories of algorithmic fault detection.  At Dayforward I led a small team that built the entire underwriting platform in under ten months. The pattern has been the same: set clear architectural direction, write code alongside the team, and ship reliable systems that deliver business impact.

I'm looking for a role where I can operate as both architect and builder. Orum's focus on scaling distributed systems and shipping GenAI features built on open-source LLMs is exactly the kind of work I'm interested in doing. 

I'd welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute.
