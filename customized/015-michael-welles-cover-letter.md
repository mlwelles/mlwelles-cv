I'm reaching out about the Senior Engineering Manager role at Cosmos Labs. Building a blockchain orchestration platform that runs in the cloud or on-prem sounds like exactly the kind of infrastructure challenge I enjoy.

At Raytheon, I led a team of 14 building real-time data platforms for aerospace applications. We processed thousands of engine sensors through ML models and had to get the reliability right because our alerts determined whether engines got grounded. The work required tight collaboration between product, engineering, and operations teams to translate complex requirements into systems that actually worked. I also spent significant time "inner-sourcing" code across 40+ teams adopting our platform, which taught me how to scale both technology and team adoption on a budget.

More recently at Istari Digital, I led a small team building secure zero-trust and zero-knowledge backend services and the client SDKs for enabling secure collaboration and automation digital engineering workflows -- to provide for digital engineering in companies like Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin what  CI/CD and package management provide for software engineering -- things verision management and lineage, automated testing for compliance and compatability, triggered execution of simulation validation on change, etc... We shipped all major milestones on time and relaunched the product for commercial and government clients. The experience gave me a healthy respect for platform reliability, security, and the importance of delivering on schedule.

I'd welcome the chance to talk about how my experience building platforms and leading engineering teams could help grow the Cosmos Stack adoption.

Best regards,
Michael Welles
