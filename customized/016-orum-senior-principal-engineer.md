About the Role


We are looking for a Senior Principal Engineer who will define the architectural vision and lead

technical execution across our engineering organization. This role is ideal for a seasoned

technologist who has designed, implemented, and scaled complex systems; collaborated deeply

with cross-functional stakeholders; and delivered high-impact projects — including Generative

AI initiatives built using open-source LLM models.


As a senior-most individual contributor, you’ll operate as a hands-on technical leader —

setting the company’s technical direction, mentoring engineers across teams, and developing

high-quality, production-grade code. You’ll act as a multiplier by pairing deep technical

expertise with strong cross-functional


Key Responsibilities

● Architectural Leadership:

Define and evolve the company’s long-term architectural vision. Provide technical direction that balances innovation, scalability, and maintainability.


● System Design and Scalability:

Design, implement, and scale distributed systems and core services to handle growth in data, users, and features.


● Cross-Team Collaboration:

Partner with Product, Engineering and business teams to align technical roadmaps with business objectives. Act as a trusted advisor to Engineering Managers and Staff Engineers.


● Generative AI Initiatives:

Lead or contribute to projects leveraging open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Falcon, or similar): own model integration, fine-tuning, and scalable deployment pipelines.


● Technical Excellence:

Establish best practices for architecture reviews, design documentation, and system observability to ensure optimal performance and reliability. Drive adoption of modern development frameworks and standards.


● Hands-on Development:

Write clean, efficient, and well-tested code. Contribute directly to core systems and

frameworks that enable teams to move faster and deliver higher-quality software.


● Mentorship & Influence:

Coach senior engineers and influence decision-making across teams through technical reviews, design sessions, and hands-on prototyping.


● Execution and Delivery:

Work closely with leadership and stakeholders to turn complex ideas into reliable, production-ready systems that deliver measurable business impact.


Qualifications


● 12+ years of experience in software engineering, with at least 4+ years in principal or

staff-plus roles.

● Proven track record designing, implementing, and scaling distributed systems or

platforms.

● Experience driving architectural initiatives across multiple teams and domains.

● Deep understanding of backend architectures, data modeling, and system reliability

patterns.

● Demonstrated success in delivering GenAI or ML-driven applications using open-source

LLMs and cloud-native infrastructure.

● Strong communication skills and the ability to influence technical and non-technical

stakeholders.

● Passion for mentorship, technical leadership, and hands-on coding.


Bonus Qualifications

● Experience with multi-tenant SaaS architecture and microservices at scale.

● Familiarity with vector databases, prompt engineering, and AI orchestration frameworks

(LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.).

● Prior experience in shaping technical strategy within high-growth startups or enterprise

environments.


What Success Looks Like

● You’ve defined and evangelized a cohesive architectural roadmap adopted across

teams.

● You’ve guided at least one major Generative AI initiative from prototype to production.

● You’re a sought-after mentor and thought leader within the engineering organization.

● Systems you design are measurable in their scalability, reliability, and developer

productivity gains.
