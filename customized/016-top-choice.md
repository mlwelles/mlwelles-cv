Perfect match for hands-on principal-level architecture and LLM integration work. Currently building LLM-based querying at CubeNexus, designed production GenAI workflows at Istari Digital, and have deep distributed systems experience from Raytheon (real-time ML pipelines) and Dayforward (microservices at scale). Role combines architectural leadership with codingâ€”exactly my strength.
