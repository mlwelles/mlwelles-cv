I'm excited about the Engineering Leader role at Basis. Building infrastructure that enables AI agents to do real accounting work is exactly the kind of technical challenge I look for.

At Istari Digital, I led the teams that built the core platform and SDK for the AI-powered automation of digital engineering workflows.  We build robust automation to verify software correctness and compliance and enabled teams ship features without breaking things. The work required translating business needs into technical direction while keeping systems simple and maintainable. That balance between ambitious technical goals and sustainable engineering practices is something I care deeply about.

What draws me to Basis is the focus on clarity and first-principles thinking. You're not just adding AI features to accounting software. You're modeling the world an AI accountant needs to operate in. That kind of systems thinking—understanding the domain deeply enough to build the right abstractions—is rare and energizing. I'd love to help build those foundations as you scale to meet demand.

I'm based in Brooklyn and would be working from your Flatiron office.
