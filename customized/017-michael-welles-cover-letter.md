I'm interested in the Principal Backend Engineer role at Medium. I've spent the last couple of decades building distributed systems that need to be fast and reliable. I care about the small stuff like latency and data correctness. I also care about the big stuff like mentoring engineers and shipping products that users actually enjoy.

At Dayforward I led a small team building an insurance underwriting platform from scratch. We built it with Go microservices on Kubernetes and a federated GraphQL API. We went from zero to production in ten months and launched the same day the company got regulatory approval. That meant no room for error on data correctness or compliance. It also meant making smart tradeoffs under tight timelines. We shipped something solid because we sweated the details and kept the architecture clean.

I've worked at startups and large companies. I've modernized legacy codebases and built new systems. I've mentored teams and shipped products used by millions. Medium's focus on quality writing and thoughtful product resonates with me. I'd love to help build the platform that powers it.
