# Cover Letter - Michael L. Welles

I'm excited to apply for the engineering leadership role at Argon. With over 20 years building high-velocity teams and distributed systems, I bring exactly the hands-on technical leadership you need to compress your build-ship-iterate loop while scaling platform reliability. At MediData, I drove 2.5× velocity gains in a heavily regulated environment by balancing pragmatic SDLC practices—lightweight planning, tight product/design/ops loops, and strong code quality guardrails—with relentless focus on shipping. I've spent the last several years building asynchronous, event-driven architectures (Kubernetes, AWS SQS/SNS, PostgreSQL) for safety-critical applications at Raytheon and Istari Digital, where I owned schema design, query optimization, zero-downtime migrations, and CI/CD pipelines that automated compliance validation for government ATO submissions. Most recently, I've been integrating LLM-based workflows into geospatial platforms, giving me direct experience with prompt engineering and AI orchestration. I care deeply about developer ergonomics, code hygiene, and setting technical standards that raise the bar without slowing flow—and I'm ready to help Argon build the infrastructure and culture that accelerates life-saving therapies to market.
