Staff Engineer (Founding Role | Rust / Distributed Systems)

Looking for a founding-level engineer to join a small, well-funded team in NYC that’s building the foundational infrastructure enabling businesses to run fast-changing, low-trust software safely and at scale. This is an opportunity to work side by side with repeat founders on deep technical problems while shaping product and culture from day one.


What you’ll work on

    High-performance asynchronous systems in Rust
    Cross-language SDKs and distributed systems across Python, TypeScript, and more
    Hybrid, multi-cloud, and on-prem deployments tailored to customer needs
    Mission-critical infrastructure providing permissions control, observability, and real-time feedback over agents in modern environments


Why this role is different

    Founding-level scope - you’ll influence every layer of the stack, not just “do X”
    Variety of challenges - no two projects are the same, each one tied to customer outcomes
    Collaborative culture - engineers test hypotheses, share ownership, and build fast together
    Balance - founders are parents themselves and value meaningful work without grind


What we’re looking for

    Staff-level engineering ability (typically 5+ years, but impact > years)
    Strong background in distributed systems, infrastructure, or developer tools
    Experience with Rust; bonus if you’ve also worked with Python/Django or TypeScript
    Someone eager to help form both technical direction and team culture


Compensation & benefits

    $170K–250K base salary + equity
    Full health, vision, and dental (family coverage included)
    5 weeks PTO (3 mandatory)
    NYC office with flexibility for relocation support
