## Overview

Hands-on engineering leader with 8+ years at Principal/Staff and Head of Engineering levels building safety-critical and data-intensive products at high velocity. Proven track record accelerating engineering teams (achieved 2.5× velocity increase at MediData) while maintaining code quality through pragmatic CI/CD, observability, and disciplined SDLC practices. Deep experience with distributed systems, asynchronous patterns (queues, DLQs, idempotency, backoff/retry, concurrency), and reliability engineering. I compress the build-ship-iterate loop by partnering closely with product and operations, setting pragmatic guardrails, automating quality signals, and modeling strong engineering culture—clear communication, code hygiene, and accountability.

## Experience

### Consulting Principal Engineer, CubeNexus.ai
*Aug 2025 - Present · Remote*

Advising on technical strategy and architecture for a geospatial intelligence platform with LLM-based querying and 3D visualization. Rebuilt ingestion pipeline to handle multi-terabyte datasets (PySpark, Pandas), added real-time telemetry streaming with event-driven architecture, hardened API backend (Python/FastAPI), and established CI/CD across repositories.

### Principal Engineer, Istari Digital

- Led team building secure backend registry service (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL). Designed database schema for asset relationships and metadata, tuned queries for complex lineage traversal, and managed zero-downtime migrations. Built TypeScript SDK for frontend integration.
- Designed cryptographically verified asset lineage and DoD‑compliant control tagging to preserve dependencies and provenance—enabling zero-knowledge collaboration and frictionless sharing among engineers and organizations.
- Implemented asynchronous processing with idempotency, retry logic, and eventual consistency for distributed asset synchronization across organizations. Built observability stack with distributed tracing and metrics for debugging complex workflows.
- Ensured CI/CD validated compliance requirements on each release, publishing results for ATO submission. Delivered all major milestones on time and successfully relaunched product for commercial and government clients.

### Director of Software Development, Raytheon Technologies
*Sep 2021 - Nov 2023 · New York, NY*

Led development of next‑generation data platform for Raytheon aerospace applications at Enterprise Data Services.

- Technical lead for pathfinder initiatives building real-time flight telemetry pipelines for Pratt & Whitney commercial jet engines. Built streaming data platform (Databricks, Spark, Python) processing thousands of engine sensors through fault detection models, triggering severity-based automated alerts.
- Designed ML model training and orchestration pipeline with comprehensive audit trails. Implemented parallel evaluation of multiple models without adding latency using asynchronous patterns and concurrent processing.
- Drove engineering velocity through lightweight planning/retros and tracked lead time, MTTR, and change failure rate across multiple parallel projects. Raised the bar on code quality, testing, and release discipline without slowing flow.
- Led effort to "inner-source" code: SDKs for parsing proprietary data formats, quickstart kits for platform projects, and synthetic data generators.
- Led team of 14 developers across three agile projects while managing onboarding and migration support for 40+ teams adopting the new platform.

### Head of Technology, Dayforward
*Jan 2020 - Sep 2021 · New York, NY*

Head of technology and development lead for a life‑insurance startup. Led small team that designed and built the company's algorithmic underwriting and policy‑management platform.

- Built platform with Go gRPC microservices on Kubernetes, federated GraphQL API, and Vue.js frontend. Designed PostgreSQL schema for policy data with complex business rules, tuned queries for performance, and managed migrations.
- Implemented asynchronous workflows with SQS/SNS for policy processing, including DLQs, idempotency, backoff/retry, and replay capabilities. Built observability with distributed tracing, metrics, and alerting for SLOs.
- Established pragmatic CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, security scanning, and release discipline. Set up infra-as-code with Terraform for AWS resources (VPC, IAM, ECS, RDS).
- Initial development completed in under ten months. Platform launched successfully the same day the company received regulatory approval—demonstrating ability to ship high-quality systems at high velocity under hard deadlines.

### Director of Software Engineering, UTC Aerospace Systems
