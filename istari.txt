\cvline{-}{Lead developerand  in rewrite to meet key security and threading obligations, creating a platform able to manage and track customer digital engineering assets threads, their derivation, lineage and interrelationships as well as managing workflow automation without any sensitive engineering data being transmitted to the platform.  The system enforced DoD compliant control tagging ensured customers retained data sovriegnity at all times-- providing strict controls and audit trails while enabling frictionless sharing of models and artifacts between not just between individual engineers and teams,but between organziation as well.   Ensured that all major DoD program milestones were on time during development and the product successfully launched  for both commercial and government clients. Led two teams designing and implementing the new secure backend registry service in Python, as well as the SDKs for accessing it, the cryptographic core of which was built in Rust, compiled both into Python bindings and webassembly as the foundational core of the Python and Typescript libraries used by the numerious automation agents and the frontend webapp that made up the rest of the platform.}
